0,,,,,"@SenGillibrand It cost you my vote. Al Franken has a great relationship with his family, loves his wife Franny. You know your call was a risk shows you saw this as a political move. He never got a chance to refute a right wing hit job due to you - you helped Stone. Shame."
0,,,,,@SenGillibrand Ballsy enough to bring up the Al Franken situation. It was a calculated risk on your part that will most likely be your most prominent identifying feature in a huge field of Democratic contenders. I think it will be the one that kills your shot at the office
0,,,,,"@SenGillibrand I will not help you, will not support you and will continue to call you out for your treatment of Al Franken, a fellow senator you must have viewed as a threat to your own presidential ambitions."

0,,,,,"@SenGillibrand Hate to say it, but Al Franken will be in the first paragraph of your obituary."
0,,,,,"@MargaretOrmrod1 @SenGillibrand Do you raise the Al Franken issue to the 34 other Senators who called publicly for his resignation, including Sanders, Warren, Harris and Booker?"
0,,,,,@SenGillibrand I’m team Al Franken. @alfranken WE STILL LOVE YOU
0,,,,,@SenGillibrand Nope. Al Franken was a great senator. I cannot forgive you for that. He was a decent man who did care about women’s rights.

0,,,,,"No, I won't donate to your campaign. I also think the US Senate would be a far better place if Al Franken was still there. https://t.co/mVcIFfnRIV"
0,,,,,"People still blaming Kirsten Gillibrand for Al Franken resigning: you need to look at some facts. Thirty Democratic senators called on him to resign, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, &amp; Sherrod Brown. 1/"
0,,,,,"@maydaymindy9 She hasn't got a snowball's chance, even without her Al Franken involvement."
0,,,,,@MSNBC First rotten remark she said: “believe everyone who accuses” right away. That’s not fair justice. And Al Franken never forcibly kissed anyone. That was Gillibrand outright lying to justify her actions. She didn’t look into the accusations to even know if they were credible
0,,,,,"It’s obvious Kirsten Gillibrand has used the MeToo movement for her own political gain. She turned on the Clinton's when she didn't need them anymore, and led the charge against Al Franken. Now we know she turned a blind eye on harassment complaints in her own office."

0,,,,,"Fact check: from the moment the woman in the Franken photo publicly revealed what happened, you were silent about Al Franken for 20 days, so silence apparently was an option for nearly three weeks while you gauged the political winds. https://t.co/Orvx6dF8R3"
